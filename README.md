## Welcome

My name is Flavio B., I am a student specializing in electronics and computer systems for network engineering at ESIEE Paris. Additionally, I work as an apprentice industrial software expert at Phoenix Contact.

I am currently studying object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C++, the enduring C language, as well as network architectures. At work, I have had the opportunity to focus primarily on Influx databases and JS.
